In <font style="font-family:Courier;">(m / </font><i>main-event</i><font style="font-family:Courier;"> :concession (c / </font><i>concession-event</i><font style="font-family:Courier;">))</font>,
the <i>concession-event</i> creates an expectation which is at least
partially invalidated by the <i>main-event</i>. The expectation can be
implied or subjective.
<p>
In English, a <i>concession-event</i> is typically signalled by the 
subordinating conjunctions although, even though, though, and albeit, 
or the prepositions despite, despite of and in spite of.
<p>
It can also be signalled on the <i>main-event</i> side by adverbs
such as however and nevertheless, or even by the conjunction but, 
particularly when but is used in conjunction with anyway.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.84 The game continued although it rained .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.85 The game continued despite of the rain .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.182 It started to rain, but the game continued anyway .

<ul>
   <li> It started to rain; but the game continued .
   <li> It started to rain; but the game continued anyway .
   <li> It started to rain; however, the game continued .
   <li> It started to rain; nevertheless, the game continued .
</ul>

EXAMPLE nw.wsj_0003.27 Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area .

<h2>Reification: have-concession-91</h2>

The reification of :concession is have-concession-91.
<p>
If a word such as nevertheless signals that there is a concession,
but that concession is outside the sentence, use the reification
have-concession-91:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.185 Nevertheless, the game continued .

<a name="contrast">
<h2>Choosing between :concession and contrast-01</h2>

Unlike contrast-01, which symmetrically contrasts two things
(John is rich, but Mary is poor. = Mary is poor, but John is rich.),
:concession is directional, i.e. the <i>concession-event</i> creates
an expectation and the <i>main-event</i> invalidates it. The 
<i>concession-event</i> and the <i>main-event</i>
cannot be switched without changing the meaning.
<p>
If you are not sure whether to use :concession or contrast-01, see
whether you can rephrase the sentence using although, which signals
:concession; otherwise use contrast-01.

<a name="even">
<h2>Special cases: even if &mdash; even as &mdash; even when</h2>

As constructions with the conjunctions even if, even as and even when have
meanings that add a hypothetical or temporal aspect, those conjunctions are
included in the AMR, much as <i>after</i> etc.  are included in temporal AMRs.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.86 The game will continue even if it rains .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.101 They feared him even when he was behind bars .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.102 Supply will rise further even as demand tapers off .
