TITLE :mode
HIGHLIGHT-RED :mode
HIGHLIGHT-RED interrogative
HIGHLIGHT-RED imperative
HIGHLIGHT-RED expressive
HIGHLIGHT-RED amr-unknown

Use :mode interrogative to mark a yes-no question.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.26 Did he die?

The role :mode is also used for imperatives:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.89 Go home !

EXAMPLE isi_0002.90 Let 's go home .

Finally, the role :mode is used to express some emotions, which do not
have the primary function of conveying information, ask a question 
(:mode interrogative) or order (:mode imperative).

EXAMPLE isi_0002.197 Yippee!

Note that "Yes." as a normal answer to a question is not marked with
any :mode, as it plainly conveys information based on the preceding
question. But a celebratory "Yes!!!" after your favorite sports team
scores an imporant point should be marked up using :mode expressive.

<hr>

Use amr-unknown as a concept to indicate the target of a question.

EXAMPLE isi_0001.14 What did the girl find?
