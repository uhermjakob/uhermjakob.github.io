The frame have-org-role-91 is used to express an organizational role relation when no verb frame is available.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.284 French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius

EXAMPLE isi_0002.291 USC Associate Professor for Mathematics Jay Bartroff

EXAMPLE isi_0002.285 Iraqi Interior Ministry operations director Major General Abdel Karim Khalaf

The frame have-org-role-91 is used even if neither the name of the office holder nor the organization is specified:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.289 The president returned to Washington.

<a name="shortcut">
<b>AMR Editor Shortcut:</b><br>
In the example above, the easiest way to add &nbsp; 
<nobr><font style="color:#007700;">:ARG0-of (h / have-org-<nobr>role</nobr>-91 :ARG2 (p2 / pre<nobr>s</nobr>ident))</font></nobr>  
&nbsp; to <i>(p / person)</i> is to type: &nbsp; 
<nobr><font style="font-family:Courier;color:#007700;">p :role pre<nobr>s</nobr>ident</font></nobr>

<p>
Words like <i>teacher</i> are still decomposed into <i>person who teaches</i> and do not by themselves
trigger the use of have-org-role. However, have-org-role-91 is used when an organization is specified:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.290 Venice High School history teacher Craig Brandau

<a name="memb-off">

have-org-role-91 is also used for the role <i>member</i> as well as for somewhat underspecified roles such as 
<i>official</i>. The following example also illustrates that the office holder can be something other than a person:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.236 Spain is a member of NATO.

EXAMPLE isi_0001.28 naval officials

<a name="military-rank">

We use have-org-role-91 for military ranks.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.286 U.S. Army General George Patton

<a name="political-party">

We use have-org-role-91 for membership in political parties and legislative bodies:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.288 Senate Republicans killed the bill.

<a name="counter">
<h2>When <b>Not</b> to Use have-org-role-91</h2>

We do <b>not</b> use have-org-role-91 if there is another verb frame available,
such as <i> head-01, lead-02, employ-01, serve-01 </i>.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.287 the head of the National Intelligence Service of Peru Vladimiro Montesinos

We also do <b>not</b> use have-org-role-91 for occupations and skills that by themselves are
independent of an organization.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.292 history teacher Craig Brandau

<a name="begin-end">
<h2>have-org-role-91 and Start/End Verbs</h2>

have-org-role-91 sometimes "competes" with frames of verbs describing the start or end of an org-role relationships,
such as <i>become, join, nominate, appoint, elect; resign, fire</i>.

In these cases, we use the frames of both have-org-role-91 and the start/end verb, and we fill all slots,
even if some entities are annotated in both frames.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.302 Barack Obama was elected president of the United States in 2008.

<a name="arg2-arg3">
<h2>:ARG2 vs. :A<nobr>R</nobr>G3</h2>

The :ARG2 of have-org-role-91 is the office held or job title. &nbsp; <i>"What is he?"</i>

EXAMPLE isi_0002.308 He is the school janitor. 

The :ARG3 of have-org-role-91 provides a description, typically using verb frames &nbsp; <i>"What does he do?"</i>

EXAMPLE isi_0002.309 He cleans bathrooms and empties the trash for the school.

In the following example, McDonough's job title is not "Chief", it is "Chief of Staff":

EXAMPLE isi_0002.310 Denis McDonough is the White House Chief of Staff.

Similarly, Fabius' job title is not "Minister", it is "Foreign Minister":

EXAMPLE isi_0002.284 French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius

Generally, :ARG2 is used much more often than :ARG3.
