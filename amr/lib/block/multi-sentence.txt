TITLE multi-sentence
HIGHLIGHT-RED multi-sentence
HIGHLIGHT-BLUE :snt1
HIGHLIGHT-BLUE :snt2
HIGHLIGHT-BLUE :snt3

When a sentence is really multiple sentences, use multi-sentence as a top,
and :snt1, :snt2 etc. as roles.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.109 I came. I saw. I conquered.

Please note that in AMR 1.1 the individual (sub-) sentences are still annotated
independently, i.e. without sharing co-reference variables. In the example
above, for example, the "I" does not have a shared co-reference variable, 
even though all three instances of "I" refer to the same person (Julius Caesar).
