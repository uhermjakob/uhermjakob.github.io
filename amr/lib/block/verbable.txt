Be careful with verb+able adjectives.
Some of them can be decomposed:
<ul>
   <li> His behavior is predictable. &nbsp; = &nbsp; His behavior can be predicted.</i>
   <li> The mortgage rate is adjustable. &nbsp; = &nbsp; The mortgage rate can be adjusted.</i>
   <li> Similarly: acceptable, reliable, understandable
</ul>
But there are many cases where this is not the case:
<ul>
   <li> &quot;taxable&quot; doesn't mean that the tax is optional.
   <li> Gandhi and Hitler are not comparable (i.e. not similar) even though they can be compared.
   <li> Similarly: reasonable, remarkable
</ul>
