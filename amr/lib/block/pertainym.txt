Some adjectives can be mapped to a nominal form, e.g. microbial &rarr; microbe.<br>
(But don't follow the suggestions blindly, because many of them were generated 
automatically using external resources.)
<ul>
   <li> Canadian &rarr; Canada
   <li> gubernatorial &rarr; governor
   <li> microbial &rarr; microbe
</ul>

Generally, annotating an adjective in its nominal form should result in a shorter word,
but there are exceptions:
<ul>
   <li> German &rarr; Germany 
   <li> Dutch &rarr; Netherlands
</ul>
