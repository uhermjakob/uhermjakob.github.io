TITLE infer-01
HIGHLIGHT-RED infer-01
HIGHLIGHT-BLUE must
HIGHLIGHT-BLUE therefore

Use infer-01 to annotate inferences, which in a sentence might be expressed
by a range of terms such as therefore or must:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.157 I think, therefore I am .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.218 John isn't here, he must be sick.

Note: However, in most cases, <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~ulf/amr/lib/popup/%6Dust.html">must</a> is annotated using obligate-01.
