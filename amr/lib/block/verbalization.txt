Here are two <b>lists</b> that might help you whether or not to verbalize
<ul style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">
   <li> <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~ulf/amr/lib/verbalize.txt" target="_verbalize">Common cases when to verbalize</a>
   <li> <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~ulf/amr/lib/do-not-verbalize.txt" target="_noverbalize">Common cases when <b>not</b> to verbalize</a>
</ul>
<p>
We map many nouns to their verbal forms:

EXAMPLE isi_0001.15 The boy's destruction of the room.
EXAMPLE isi_0002.261 I met his math teacher.

But we don't map all nouns that have a related verb sense:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.262 California governor Jerry Brown

A <i>governor</i> is not just a person who governs. It's a specific rank.
Governors govern, but not all who govern are governors, including
presidents, mayors, and other members of the executive branch.
<br>
Similarly: chairman, contractor, correspondent, director, editor, president, treasurer
<p>
We also don't verbalize adjectives such as <i>white</i> to <i>whiten</i>, because <i>whiten</i>
means <i>to make white</i> rather than <i>to be white</i>. Something can be white
without ever having been whitened: it might have been white from the beginning of its existence.
For the same reasons, we don't map from <i>familiar</i> to <i>familiarize</i>.
<br>
Similarly: deaf, deep, glad, hard, legal, liquid, modern, popular, ripe, sad, simple, soft, stable, wide
