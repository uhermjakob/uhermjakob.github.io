We normally select the named entity type from
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~ulf/amr/lib/ne-types.html" title="Show list of named-entity types" target="_BLANK"><b>this</b></a> 
list of NE types.
<br>
However, if there is a more specific type explicitly mentioned <b>outside</b> the name, we use that concept as a type.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.316 He works for AFP.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.317 He works for the news agency AFP.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.247 He works for Bank of America.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.249 She works for UBS, a big Swiss bank.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.209 The poet William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon.

EXAMPLE nw.wsj_0001.2 Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V. , the Dutch publishing group.

Note: Mr., Mrs., Ms., Miss etc. are considered to be part of the name.
<p>
In the following two examples, we select the standard NE types country-region and spaceship ,
because region is actually <u>less</u> specific than country-region and spacecraft and
spaceship are synonymns (equally specific).

EXAMPLE isi_0002.318 They come from Sudan's Darfur region.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.319 China launched the Shenzhou spacecraft.
