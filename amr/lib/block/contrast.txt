Contrastive conjunctions such as but, while, whereas, 
prepositions such as <font color="blue">in c&#8203;ontrast to</font>
and the adverbials such as however, on the other hand
are rendered using the concept contrast-01:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.103 I like classical music, but John likes jazz .

The example above also captures the sentences
<ul>
   <li> I like classical music, whereas John likes jazz .
   <li> While I like classical music, John likes jazz .
   <li> I like classical music, <font color="blue">in c&#8203;ontrast to</font> John who likes jazz .
   <li> I like classical music. John, however, likes jazz .
   <li> On the one hand, I like classical music. On the other hand, John likes jazz .
   <li> My liking of classical music contrasts with John's liking of jazz .
</ul>

contrast-01 is symmetric, i.e. the arguments of contrast-01 can typically be swapped
without changing the meaning:<br>
<i>I like classical music, whereas John likes jazz.</i>
&nbsp; = &nbsp; <i>John likes jazz, whereas I like classical music.</i>
<p>
Note that in some cases such as in ``<i>It started to rain, but the game continued anyway.</i>''
but signals a <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~ulf/amr/lib/popup/concession.html">:concession</a>
rather than a contrast-01.
