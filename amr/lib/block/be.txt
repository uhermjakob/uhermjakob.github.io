The English verb to be <nobr>i&#8203;s</nobr> annotated in a number of ways:

<hr>
"X is Y" constructions <nobr>ar&#8203;e</nobr> generally annotated as "Y :domain X"

EXAMPLE isi_0002.24 My cousin is a lawyer.

EXAMPLE isi_0001.7 The girl is sad.

EXAMPLE isi_0001.25 The boy is a hard worker.

Note: NEVER use be-01 in AMRs.<br>
Note: The inverse of :domain i<nobr>s</nobr> :mod.

<hr>
However, when to be <nobr>i&#8203;s</nobr> used to <nobr>describ&#8203;e</nobr> an attribute for which <nobr>ther&#8203;e</nobr> <nobr>i&#8203;s</nobr> a suitable AMR role such as <b>location, time, age</b>, we use that role:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.154 The knife is in the drawer .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.156 My grandmother is 85 .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.155 Our next meeting will be on Friday at 11<nobr>a&#8203;m</nobr> .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.158 There is a knife in the drawer .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.153 There was a big explosion .

EXAMPLE nw.wsj_0003.7 There is no asbestos in our products now .

<hr>
Do NOT include an <b>auxiliary</b> to be in an AMR,
for example when it <nobr>i&#8203;s</nobr> used to express continuous tense or passive:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.152 They are sleeping .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.62 The boy is permitted to go.

<hr>
Use be-02 for the <b>existential</b> be (but not for <i>there is</i> etc.). <nobr>Thi&#8203;s</nobr> sense <nobr>i&#8203;s</nobr> relatively <nobr>rar&#8203;e</nobr>.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.157 I think, therefore I am .

EXAMPLE isi_0002.151 To be or not to be : that is the question . 

<hr>
