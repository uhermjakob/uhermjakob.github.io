We use rate-entity-91 to express frequencies and other rate entities.

Argument structure:
<ul>
   <li> :ARG1 &nbsp; quantity (with an implied default of 1)
   <li> :ARG2 &nbsp; per quantity
   <li> :ARG3 &nbsp; regular interval between events 
   <li> :ARG4 &nbsp; entity on which recurring event happens
</ul>

:ARG2 and :ARG3 are somewhat similar, but :ARG3 is more specific than :ARG2
in that it describes a <u>regular</u> interval between events, which :ARG2 does not, 
or at least not necessarily.<br>
In the following two examples, <i>twice a year</i> could refer to something
occurring every Thanksgiving and Christmas, not necessarily every six months.
<p>
Note that in the <i>earnings</i> example below, the employee probably never
gets $42,000 at any one time, but more likely $3,500 every month. The employee
might not even work for the company for a full year and therefore earn a total
of less than $42,000. So the $42,000 per year is an earning <i>rate</i> rather 
than a $42,000 earning event happening once a year. 
This difference is similar to the difference between a distance and a speed:
<i>He drove 50 miles.</i> vs. <i>He drove 50 miles per hour.</i> where the
latter case is about speed and does not say anything about the distance driven.
So you can think of <i>$42,000 per year</i> as a "monetary speed."
