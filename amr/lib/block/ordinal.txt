An ordinal number defines a thing's position in a series, e.g. first, second, or third.
We use the role :ord and the corresponding cardinal number (1, 2, 3) to express an ordinal.
Ordinals can be qualified (e.g. first in 10 years), so we include a concept ordinal-entity
to accommodate both the primary value as well as any qualifications.

<a name="basic">
<h2>Basic Ordinals</h2>
EXAMPLE isi_0002.237 the second planet

<b>Note:</b> In the <font color="#007700">AMR Editor</font>, you can just type in &nbsp; <font style="font-family:Courier;color:#007700;">p :o<nobr>r</nobr>d 2</font> &nbsp; 
as a &nbsp;<b>shortcut</b>&nbsp; for &nbsp; <nobr><font style="font-family:Courier;color:#007700;">p :o<nobr>r</nobr>d ordinal-value</font></nobr> &nbsp; and &nbsp; <nobr><font style="font-family:Courier;color:#007700;">o :v<nobr>a</nobr>lue 2</font></nobr>

EXAMPLE isi_0002.259 He was the first to do this.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.260 When I met her for the first time, Mary still worked for Goldman Sachs.

<a name="range">
<h2>Ordinals with :range</h2>
EXAMPLE isi_0002.238 our first visit in 10 years

EXAMPLE isi_0002.252 first victory in 12 games

<a name="interval">
<h2>Intervals of Ordinals</h2>
As an alternative to a simple value, AMR also also offers a <b>value-interval</b>, including an open interval:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.253 second to fourth week

EXAMPLE isi_0002.254 floors 3 and higher

<a name="negative">
<h2><i>Last</i> Ordinals</h2>
For expressions such as "second to last", AMR uses a <b>negative ordinal</b> value:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.255 the second to last episode

EXAMPLE isi_0002.239 We sat in the preantepenultimate pew.

<a name="superlative">
<h2>Ordinals and Superlatives</h2>
Example combining an <b>ordinal and a superlative</b>

EXAMPLE isi_0002.256 Texas is the second largest state in the U.S.

However, we don't use ordinals for plain superlatives, i.e. is <i>:ord (o / ordinal-entity :value 1)</i> is understood as a default.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.30 the brightest boy

<a name="fuzzy">
<h2>"Fuzzy Ordinals"</h2>
<b>But</b> don't use :ord for "fuzzy ordinals" such as:

EXAMPLE isi_0002.257 Canada is one of the largest countries in the world.

EXAMPLE isi_0002.258 Canada and the U.S. are among the largest countries in the world.

<a name="counter">
<h2>When <b>not</b> to use :ord</h2>
But do <b>not</b> use :ord for <i>last</i> in the sense of <i>previous</i>
as in "I bought a new car <i>last week</i>." or for <i>first</i> in the
sense of <i>initially</i> as in "I <i>first</i> had to get used to it."
