SURF: amino-acid
   DATE-ADDED: 2014-11-25
   SEM: definition
      ENTRY: An amino-acid is an organic molecule.
      ENTRY: Amino acids can be chained together and folded to form proteins. Proteins contain 23 types of amino acids, such as serine. &nbsp <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid#Table_of_standard_amino_acid_abbreviations_and_properties" target="_AMINO_ACID_TABLE" title="Click for table of amino acids with abbreviations">Table $external_link_img</a>.
      ENTRY: Technically, when they two amino acids are chained together, they lose an -H and an -OH respectively (combined to water), leaving two amino acid <i>residues</i>.
   SEM: example
      ENTRY: ERK phosphorylates B-Raf on the S151 site.

SURF: downregulation/upregulation
   ANCHOR: upregulation
   DATE-ADDED: 2014-11-05
   LINK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation
   SEM: definition
      ENTRY: Downregulation (or downmodulation) is a process where some instances of a protein (or other molecule) are deactivated or dismantled. If the downregulated molecule is an enzyme, the activity ("signaling") from that type of enzyme is reduced.
      ENTRY: Conversely, <b>upregulation</b> (or upmodulation) is a process where some instances of a protein (or other molecule) are activated or built up. If the upregulated molecule is an enzyme, the activity ("signaling") from that type of enzyme is increased.
   SEM: frame downregulate/upregulate
      ENTRY: Both the agent and the target of downregulation/upregulation can be enzymes.

SURF: effector
   DATE-ADDED: 2014-12-03
   SEM: definition
      ENTRY: a molecule that is not directly involved in a chemical reaction, but weakly binds to an enzyme (or other protein), changing it to make it more (or less) able to perform its normal function. Therefore, effectors can be used to speed up (or slow down) certain reactions.
   SEM: annotation
      ENTRY: Do <b>not</b> map to affect-01 or other, since it's a more specific technical term.

SURF: enzyme
   DATE-ADDED: 2014-11-05
   LINK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme
   SEM: definition
      ENTRY: large organic molecule (typically a protein) or macro-molecular-complex (containing a protein)
      ENTRY: acts as an :instrument of biochemical processes, more specifically as a catalyst
      ENTRY: often has activated and deactivated forms (e.g. activated by phosphorylation)
   SEM: entity type
      ENTRY: Annotate an enzyme as an enzyme even if the text describes it as a "protein" (which is more general). But if the text uses something more specific than an enzyme, such as kinase, use that more specific type.
   SEM: examples
      ENTRY: ERK phosphorylates B-Raf on the S151 site.
	 PSEUDO: (phosphorylate-01 :ARG1 (amino-acid :mod 151 "serine" :part-of (enzyme "B-Raf")) :ARG2 (enzyme "ERK"))

SURF: phosphorylation
   DATE-ADDED: 2014-11-05
   LINK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorylation 
   SEM: definition   
      ENTRY: process that modifies an organic molecule by adding a phosphate
	  ENTRY: often applied to a protein, more specifically to certain amino acids that are part of a protein
      ENTRY: often activates or deactivates enzymes and other proteins<br>Example:  If amino acid Serine-473 ("S473") in the protein AKT is phosphorylated, AKT is, in general, functionally active as a kinase. If not, it is an inactive kinase.
      ENTRY: Reverse process: dephosphorylation
      ENTRY: hyperphosphorylation: protein with multiple phosphorylation sites is fully saturated   
      ENTRY: Common source of phosphate added in phosphorylation: ATP (= adenosine <b><u>tri</u>phosphate</b>) which donates one of its phosphates and becomes ADP (= adenosine <b><u>di</u>phosphate</b>)  
      ENTRY: Typical agent: enzyme
   SEM: frame for phosphorylate-01
      LINK: http://www.isi.edu/~ulf/amr/ontonotes-4.0-frames/phosphorylate-v.html#phosphorylate01
	  ENTRY: :ARG0 agent of phosphorylation (e.g. person, process)
	  ENTRY: :ARG1 thing phosphorylated; typically a protein or other organic molecule
	  ENTRY: :ARG2 instrument (typically an enzyme)

      ENTRY: major building block of living things
      ENTRY: can be agents of biochemical processes (enzymes)
      ENTRY: Proteins are encoded by genes. The physical expression of genes into proteins consists of two steps: (1) enzymes <i>transcribe</i> genes into messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and then (2) ribosomes <i>translate</i> these messenger RNAs into proteins.
   SEM: components of a protein
      ENTRY: A protein is a chain of many amino acid residues (An amino acid <i>residue</i> is an amino acid minus a -OH and a -H group, which are discarded as water when two amino acids are bound together as links in a protein chain in a process called polymerization).
      ENTRY: A term such as "S151" refers to a specific amino acid ("S" = serine; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid#Table_of_standard_amino_acid_abbreviations_and_properties" target="_AMINO_ACID_TABLE" title="Click for table of amino acids with abbreviations">table $external_link_img</a>) at a specific position ("151") in the chain of amino acid residues that make up a protein. A prefix "p" (as in "pS151") indicates that the amino acid is <a href="#phosphorylation">phosphorylated</a>.
      ENTRY: A protein-segment is a sub-chain of one or more amino acids.
      ENTRY: Some protein-segments are referred to as a <a href="#domain"><b>domain</b></a> or <b>motif</b> or <b>(binding) site</b>.
