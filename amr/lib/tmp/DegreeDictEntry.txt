   SEM: have-degree-91
	  ENTRY: <b>Note</b> that Have-degree-91 is the reification of :degree.  Annotators need not use the roleset when :degree expressions alone are used (e.g., He's VERY tall), but should use the roleset when other arguments are invoked (see below).  
   SEM: comparative
      ENTRY: <b>more</b> intelligent
	 PSEUDO: (intelligent <b>:degree more</b>)
	 EXAMPLE: isi_0002.380

	 PSEUDO: (have-degree-91 :ARG1 girl :ARG2 tall :ARG3 more :ARG4 boy)
	 EXAMPLE: isi_0001.27
	  ENTRY: <b>Note</b> that Annotators are encouraged to use have-degree-91 as the root concept (as opposed to the adjective with a particular degree, or the entity characterized by that adjective) when a comparison seems to be the main focus of the sentence. This includes copular constructions where the main verb is BE, like the above sentence. 
   SEM: superlative

      ENTRY: <b>Note</b> that some concepts such as "high" can be :degree intensifiers in some contexts (e.g. <i>I highly recommend that dentist.</i> and <i>The chemical is highly stable.</i>), but not in others (e.g. <i>high speed</i> or <i>The mountain is very high.</i>). One test to determine whether something is an intensifier is to see whether it can naturally be replaced by the common intensifiers <i>very</i> or <i>very much</i>.

      ENTRY: <b>Note</b> that the primary relation of the Consequence argument may be elided or unspecified, as it is above.  Annotators should introduce the most logical relation fitting with the context, above, “fit.”  The consequence can generally be thought of as completing a “Thus,” or “therefore” statement: The watch is too wide; therefore, the watch doesn’t fit my wrist. Annotators may need to introduce :polarity -, and should carefully consider where to place this marker (as always).

   SEM: when to use Have-degree-91 vs. Have-quant-91
	  ENTRY: <b>Note</> that in general,  Have-Degree-91 is used with gradable properties, often expressed as an adjective (taller, less powerful, most totalitarian, etc) or adverb (more quickly, further).  Have-Quant-91 is used with clear quantities of things, and those things are generally expressed as nouns and a quantifier (more money, less oversight, the most cars).  Nonetheless, there can be some ambiguous overlap between the two.  At the most basic level, consider: Is it a property or a quantity under discussion? If uncertain, Have-Degree-91 is a more general roleset than Have-Quant-91, so the default should be Have-Degree-91.  This test may be helpful in cases where the potential property/quantity word is ambiguous: the word should be modifiable by 'many' or 'much' if appropriate for Have-Quant-91. 
	  ENTRY: The girl is <b>taller</b> than the boy (*'the girl is much/many tall,' therefore use have-degree 91)
	  ENTRY: He bought <b>as much beer as</b> he could carry ('he bought much beer,' therefore use have-quant-91)
	  ENTRY: The product has <b>far more monetary value</b> on the black market ('product has much monetary value,' therefore use have-quant-91)
	  ENTRY: They supplied at a <b>lower price</b> (*'at a much/many low,' therefore use have-degree-91)
	  ENTRY: The total was <b>far higher</b> than expected (*'total was much/many high,' therefore use have-degree-91)
	  ENTRY: You have done <b>more</b> to screw this country up <b>than</b> the democrats ('you have done much,' therefore use have-quant-91)
