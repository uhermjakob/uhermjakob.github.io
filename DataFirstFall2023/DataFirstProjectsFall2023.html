There is however only anecdotal evidence about whether muni networks deliver on the promise of more affordable broadband in communities of little interest to traditional ISPs - typically disadvantaged communities. Taking advantage of the greater level of resolution in the new FCC broadband availability maps, this project will examine broadband pricing and adoption at the address level in areas served by muni networks, using a matched sample of comparable areas as a reference point. The goal of the project is to empirically assert whether muni networks are delivering on the promise of more affordable services, and whether this results in more household adoption than expected.

<tr><td>Question type coding is used in research on forensic interviewing to distinguish between best practice open-ended questions, and closed-ended and leading questions that interviewers are trained to avoid. Most research teams in the field rely on a time-consuming and labor-intensive method of question type coding whereby a researcher codes every question in the interview, and a second researcher codes a subset to demonstrate inter-rater reliability. We are currently working with a graduate of the Masters in Computer Science program at USC on a project exploring automated question type coding of forensic interviews with victims of child abuse. In collaboration with the student, we have trained a large language model (RoBERTa) to distinguish between question types based on a rudimentary classification system. In the next stage of the project, we are aiming to finetune the model and use zero shot and few shot prompting to make distinctions for which there is limited manually-coded data.

<tr><td>When it comes to classification tasks, many previous work has tried to design larger and more complex neural networks. Recently, the line of data-centric AI has worked on shifting the focus to the quality of the train data. This shift arises from the recognition that the annotations associated with dataset instances can exhibit both noise, stemming from vague instructions or human errors, and bias, arising from differing perspectives among annotators in response to given prompts.
In this project, our objective is to bridge the gap between the two lines of research: one dedicated to identifying noisy instances and the other striving to account for the diverse perspectives of annotators. Specifically, we will delve into the domain of offensive text detection datasets, a highly subjective task. Our investigation will center on whether perspectivist classification models have effectively harnessed valuable information from instances flagged as noisy by noise-detection techniques. </td></tr>

3. Inject Bad Writing: For each element of the rubric, develop prompts for generative AI to decrease the quality of writing based on the rubric (i.e., make it worse). This will form a training data set of the good example and version worse on certain characteristics.
4. Fine Tune: Students will be expected to attempt to fine tune an LLM (e.g., LLAMA 2) based on this synthetically generated data
